- GPUs are incredibly popular for accelerating computationally heavy workloads. Essential for HPC, AI, and scientific computing tasks

# Why Use Chapel for GPU Programming?

- Simplicity and Efficiency
- Unified Programming Model
  - The use of the Locale model to represent GPUs just like distributed computation


# Key Features of Chapel for GPU Execution

{{<grid "keyFeatures">}}

# Example: Matrix Multiplication

- Simple matrix multiplication using no GPUs
- MatMul WITH GPUs
- Compare to MatMul with CUDA
- Compare to MatMul with OpenCL
- Compare to MatMul with PyCUDA?
