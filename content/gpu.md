- GPUs are incredibly popular for accelerating computationally heavy workloads. Essential for HPC, AI, and scientific computing tasks

# Why Use Chapel for GPU Programming?

- Simplicity and Efficiency
- Unified Programming Model
  - The use of the Locale model to represent GPUs just like distributed computation


# Key Features of Chapel for GPU Execution

1. Unified Syntax
  - No need to write separate kernels for GPUs and CPUs
  - Example code with the changes to a forall loop for GPU execution
2. Multi-Level Abstractions for GPU Programming
  - Mixture of high and low level control over execution, distribution, data transfer
3. Portability Across Hardware
  - Same code runs on Nvidia, AMD, Intel GPUs


# Example: Matrix Multiplication

- Simple matrix multiplication using no GPUs
- MatMul WITH GPUs
- Compare to MatMul with CUDA
- Compare to MatMul with OpenCL
- Compare to MatMul with PyCUDA?

# Use Cases for Chapel's Built-In GPU Support

- HPC and Scientific Computing
  - Large-scale simulations, fluid dynamics, weather modeling
- AI and Machine Learning
  - Training deep neural networks and other GPU-intensive tasks
- Data Analytics and Genomics
  - Accelerate data processing and analysis for bioinformatics
