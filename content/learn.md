## I like to read

**"I'd like to read something short that would give me a taste of Chapel's features."**

See this series of annotated ["Hello World" variants](docs/examples/index.html) which introduce a few core Chapel features for task-parallelism, data-parallelism, and distributed computing.

**"I'd like to read a more in-depth overview of Chapel's background, features, and plans."**

Read the [**Chapel** chapter](publications/PMfPC-Chapel.pdf) from [_Programming Models for Parallel Computing_](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262528818/programming-models-for-parallel-computing/) from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/).  

**"I'd like to read an extensive example-oriented introduction to Chapel."**

See our [**series of articles**](blog/tags/advent-of-code-2022/) about writing the first twelve Advent of Code 2022 challenges in Chapel on the [Chapel blog](blog/index.html).

**"I'd like to read a more complete description of Chapel."**

See the [**online documentation**](docs/) including the [**language specification**](docs/language/spec/index.html).

# I like to watch talks or browse their slides


**"I'd like to watch an introductory Chapel talk."**

Watch this [**Chapel overview talk**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxXqo8lYsI4) or browse its presentation [slides](presentations/ChapelForLinuxCon-presented.pdf).

**"I'd like to watch more of a tutorial introduction to Chapel."**

Check out our [**tutorials page**](tutorials.html) for links to videos and slides..

**"I don't have much time and would like to watch a shorter introduction to Chapel."**

This pair of talks from [**PNW PLSE 2023**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZQlheDo28Y) and [**2024**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydsM51T7Pts) are short and sweet.

**"I'd like to see other Chapel technical talks."**

Head over to our [**presentations page**](presentations.html) or [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@ChapelLanguage) for a number of talk videos and slides.

## I like to watch programming demos

**"I'd like to see a demonstration of Chapel (or Arkouda) in action."**

Check out our [**Chapel Tutorials and Demonstrations**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuqM5RJ2KYFgllPMfP5OiRKsVRPf1UEDs) playlist on YouTube.

## I like to read code

**"I'd like to see simple examples of Chapel's parallel and distributed features in action."**

Browse [**serial, parallel, and distributed hello world**](docs/examples/index.html) examples online.  

**"I'd like to read a 'learn X in Y Minutes' style introduction to Chapel."**

See [**Learn Chapel in Y Minutes**](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/chapel/).

**"I'd like to read code examples that teach about specific Chapel concepts or features."**

Browse the [**primer examples**](docs/primers/) included with the Chapel release.

**"I'd like to look through sample computations in Chapel."**

Browse the [**benchmarks directory**](https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/tree/main/test/release/examples/benchmarks) from the Chapel release.

## I like to learn by coding

**"I'd like to install Chapel."**

See the [**downloading Chapel**](download) instructions.  

**"I'd like to try Chapel without installing it."**

See [**this page**](tryit.html) about using Chapel with GitHub Codespaces or Attempt This Online.

**"I'd like some coding exercises to work through."**

Try some [**hands-on exercises**](handson.html) we use in tutorials.  

Or try your hand at the first twelve [**Advent of Code 2022**](https://adventofcode.com/2022) exercises, comparing your solutions to those we wrote about in our [**series of articles**](blog/series/advent-of-code-2022/) on the [Chapel blog](blog/index.html).
